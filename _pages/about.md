This is just a place for me to document and share my newfound fascination with mathematics. In the summer of 2022 at North Carolina's Governor's School West, I got to attend several math lectures. These lectures changed my perspective on mathematics. I had always been somewhat interested in math, but never enough to explore it in my free time. Math was a means to an end, nothing more. Attending those lectures helped me see the beauty in mathematics, and since then I have tried to teach myself some mathematical concepts in my free time. I haven't had much free time to explore this interest, but I return to my notebook whenever I can. I have several notebooks filled with art, to-do lists, birthday cards, cool flowers, chemistry notes, and my math explorations. They are labelled as Books 0, 1, 2, and 3. As this is intended to be the highlights from these books, I've named this site Book N.
There's no particular audience for this site. It's mostly for my own benefit, but I've chosen to leave it public so I can share this with friends.
Projects can be found in the blog section. I hate that it's called the blog section, but I cannot think of a better name.
