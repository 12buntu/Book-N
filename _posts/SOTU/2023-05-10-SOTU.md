description: my take on a presentation that changed my life.
---

Today I tried to recreate for my chemistry class a presentation that changed my life. At Governor's School last year one of the math teachers gave an optional lectured titled *Shape of the Universe*. Although this wasn't the only math lecture I attended at Governor's School, and I probably wouldn't have said it was my favorite at the time, it is the one that has stuck with me the most. The original *Shape of the Universe* presentation, along with the other math presentations at Governor's School, really changed my perspective on math. I began to view math as a collection of concepts to be understood, rather than a set of problems to be solved. This presentation in particular helped shift my view, as it contained almost no numbers. It made me realize that numbers were just one way to explore mathematical concepts. Numbers are a tool to understand math, not the purpose of math itself. All that being said, this is my textual adaptation of the presentation I gave today:

# What is topology?

Topology is a bit difficult to define with words; the definition given by a quick Google search is "*the study of geometric properties and spatial relations unaffected by the continuous change of shape or size of figures.*". This definition is a bit difficult to understand, so I find it easier to use an image to explain.

 INSERT TOPOLOGY IMAGE
 Caption: Objects are topologically the same if you can stretch, compress, or bend one shape to produce the other. They are not the same if you have to cut, glue, create a hole, or close a hole.


The top row of images are all topologically the same because they contain no holes. Any one of those could be stretched and misshappen to form any of the others. The shapes in the second row, although they are visually similar, are not topologically the same. One contains a hole, while the other is simply a circle bent into a strange shape. This means they are topologically different, as you could not create the donut shape from the other shape without cutting or glueing faces.
This is important to note because when I refer to the shape of the universe, I am really referring to its topology. Some of the models I'll be showing aren't uniformly sized. This isn't to imply that one part of the universe would be larger than another; we are only concerned with the *connectedness* of the theoretical spaces. This will make more sense after we look at some visuals.

# A Two Dimensional Universe
Before we explore what the shape of a three dimensional universe might look like, it is useful to think about possible shapes of a two dimensional universe. Let's use the analogy of a game of Pacman.
 INSERT CYLINDER PAC MAN GIF
The important thing to note here is how Pacman seems to teleport across the screen upon reaching the edge. You could think of this as teleportation through programming magic, but for the sake of this exercise it is better to think of those two locations as physically joined. To physically join these two locations, you must bend the entire screen to form a cylinder.
 INSERT IMAGE OF CYLINDER RENDERED IN 3D
 Caption: The above image, as well as all the other 3D renderings of the Pacman world, come from Lev Kruglyak's blog, which I will link at the bottom of this post.

This shows that Pacman does not simply teleport across the screen, but is simply moving around the outside of a cylinder. Of course, Pacman has no understanding of moving through a 3rd dimension. Just as you probably can't imagine moving through a fourth spacial dimension, Pacman can't understand that he exists on the surface of a 3D object.
