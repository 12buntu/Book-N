description: my take on a presentation that changed my life.
---

Today I tried to recreate for my chemistry class a presentation that changed my life. At Governor's School last year one of the math teachers gave an optional lectured titled *Shape of the Universe*. Although this wasn't the only math lecture I attended at Governor's School, and I probably wouldn't have said it was my favorite at the time, it is the one that has stuck with me the most. The original *Shape of the Universe* presentation, along with the other math presentations at Governor's School, really changed my perspective on math. I began to view math as a collection of concepts to be understood, rather than a set of problems to be solved. This presentation in particular helped shift my view, as it contained almost no numbers. It made me realize that numbers were just one way to explore mathematical concepts. Numbers are a tool to understand math, not the purpose of math itself. All that being said, this is my textual adaptation of the presentation I gave today:

# What is topology?

Topology is a bit difficult to define with words; the definition given by a quick Google search is "*the study of geometric properties and spatial relations unaffected by the continuous change of shape or size of figures.*". This definition is a bit difficult to understand, so I find it easier to use an image to explain.
