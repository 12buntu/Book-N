description: a silly little stats project.

This is not my favorite math project I've ever done---it isn't the most sound statistical analysis---but I am happy with it. My friend Matias did most of the formatting, which I very much appreciate and probably wouldn't publish here if it weren't for the wonderful formatting. He has started his own math-based website: https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/ which I hope to read and keep up with.

Anyway, here's the project. Big thanks to App State student Maddie Chang for allowing us to use her data for this project!
